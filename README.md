# Two-Sigma-Kaggle

This repo stores my main script and unorgnized EAD for two sigma kaggle modeling challenge.

## Overview

In competition, the dataset provided in this competition contains anonymized features pertaining to a time-varying value for a financial instrument. Each instrument has an id. Time is represented by the 'timestamp' feature and the variable to predict is 'y'. No further information will be provided on the meaning of the features, the transformations that were applied to them, the timescale, or the type of instruments that are included in the data. 

People is supposed to submit his model in terms of python script to kaggle kernel. To avoid any form of forward-looking prediction, the kaggle kernel will evaluate the performance of the model timestamp by timestamp and return the average R.
